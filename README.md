from which I took inspiration to create bash script. I also went ahead and created a powershell script.

## How to Run:

- Download the release v1.0.0 and extract the contents of it in the folder you wish to organise.

- For organise.py file, you need to install python 3 (duh!)

  Then Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where file is present, and issue following command `python organise.py`

- For organise.sh file, you need to give permission to it for execution:

  1. Either from File Manager:

     1.a. Right click on file and click on Properties

     ![Alt text](/assets/properties.png)

     1.b. Go to Permissions Tab and check 'Is executable'

     ![Alt text](/assets/permissions.png)

     1.c. Click on OK.

  2. Or through terminal:

     2.a. Open terminal window, navigate to the directory where file is present, and issue following command `chmod +x organise.sh`

  You can then simply double-clik on the file to run it or run it from the terminal by issuing the command `./organise.sh`

- For organise.ps1 file you can simply right-click on the file and click on 'Run with Powershell'
